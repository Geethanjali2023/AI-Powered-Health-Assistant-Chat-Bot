Chatbots enable communication using either text or voice interfaces and provide responses using artificial intelligence. 

Typically, chatbots engage in conversations with real individuals and find applications in areas like E-commerce customer support, call centers, and online gaming. These software programs can be configured to provide consistent responses, vary their responses based on specific keywords, or use machine learning to adapt their replies to specific situations. Recently, healthcare institutions, including hospitals, nursing homes, and private clinics, have adopted online chatbots to offer human services. These chatbots assist potential patients by aiding them in discovering medical specialists, scheduling appointments, and facilitating access to appropriate treatments. 

Nevertheless, the incorporation of artificial intelligence in an industry where people's lives are at stake raises concerns and questions regarding whether certain tasks should remain within the purview of human staff. Healthcare chatbot systems operate 24/7, addressing a wide range of medical inquiries, generating leads, and automatically delivering lead information to sales teams. They employ a series of questions to guide patients in finding the information they seek.
